  latitude: -37.8165717,

  description: "Opposite Federation Square and joining Flinders Lane with Flinders Street, the cobblestoned Hosier Lane is arguably the central point of the city's street art scene. Spend a long while checking out every little bit of this overflowing art cluster â€“ a creative mark has been left on almost anything with a surface and sometimes it's the smaller, easily-overlooked pieces that really astound."
